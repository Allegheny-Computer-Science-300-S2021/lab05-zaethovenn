#### Part 1.

 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

for this analysisi i used the online demo for the needleman wunsch model to compare the two strings of sequences. 

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 the two sequences are very similar only having a couple proteins off. The score for the two compared sequences was 1 and most pairs are matches. 

 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 I believe they are closely related due to the make up of the two sequences being almost identical with only a few minor misses. 

 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?

all of the proof is within the data with the needleman wunsch algorithm. Using this we can tell that the two genetic codes match up with eachother very well with only a few changes. there are very few mismatches and gaps to differ the two sequences from eachother. 

#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

the lowest similarity rating for these three sequences was around 95%. a score of 95% on simmilarity is very close to identical. the highest gap was 2.5 % with a low of 1.1. BC has the most compatibility

 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?

I do not believe that with this data we can make a claim that the virus is changing that might concern human to human transmission. this study is very small but with the claims the virus is still very similar to the other versions so we should be able to combat it. 

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?
